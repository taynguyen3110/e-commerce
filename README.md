# E-Commerce Website Front-End

This is the front-end implementation of an e-commerce website based on a sample Figma design. The project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **Firebase** services for backend functionality such as authentication, database management, and storage.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to develop a responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing e-commerce website. The UI closely follows a **Figma design** template to ensure a consistent and high-quality user experience.

### Key Features:
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework to streamline the styling process.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Enables secure user authentication with email/password and social media login.
- **Firebase Firestore**: Real-time database for storing and retrieving product and user data.
- **Firebase Storage**: Used for hosting product images and other media assets.
- **Product Listings**: Dynamic display of products, categorized and filterable by various criteria.
- **Shopping Cart**: Allows users to add, update, and remove products in their cart.
- **Checkout**: Users can complete their purchase by filling out a simple checkout form.

## Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**:
  - **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Backend/Services**:
  - **Firebase**:
    - **Authentication**: Handles user login and sign-up.
    - **Firestore**: A real-time database for storing product and user data.
    - **Storage**: Manages product images and other media.
    - **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting for easy deployment and fast content delivery.

## Installation

### Prerequisites:
- **Node.js** (>=14.x)
- **npm** or **yarn** (package manager)

### Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-website.git
   cd ecommerce-website
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or if using yarn
   yarn install
   ```

3. Firebase Configuration:
   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Enable **Firebase Authentication**, **Firestore**, and **Storage** in your Firebase console.
   - Copy your Firebase configuration details (API key, Auth domain, etc.) from your Firebase project settings.
   - Replace the Firebase config in `src/firebase.js` with your Firebase project credentials:
     ```js
     // src/firebase.js
     import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
     import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
     import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";
     import { getStorage } from "firebase/storage";

     const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "your-api-key",
       authDomain: "your-auth-domain",
       projectId: "your-project-id",
       storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket",
       messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
       appId: "your-app-id",
     };

     const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

     export const auth = getAuth(app);
     export const firestore = getFirestore(app);
     export const storage = getStorage(app);
     ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or if using yarn
   yarn start
   ```

5. The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Firebase Services

### Authentication:
- Supports **Email/Password** and **Social Media** logins (Google, Facebook, etc.).
- You can sign up, log in, and log out using Firebase Authentication.

### Firestore Database:
- Products are dynamically loaded from Firestore.
- The database stores product details such as name, price, description, and images.

### Storage:
- Product images and other assets are managed via Firebase Storage.

## Deployment

To deploy this app to **Firebase Hosting**, follow these steps:

1. Install Firebase CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. Authenticate with Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. Initialize Firebase in your project:
   ```bash
   firebase init
   ```

4. Deploy to Firebase Hosting:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy
   ```

After deploying, your website will be available at the Firebase Hosting URL.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, and log out with Firebase Authentication.
- **Product Listings**: Dynamically fetched from Firestore, users can browse and filter products.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to the cart and view the total price.
- **Checkout**: A simple form that collects user information for completing the purchase.

## Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading**: Images and components are lazily loaded to improve initial load time.
- **Code Splitting**: React Router and other large components are split into smaller chunks for faster loading.
